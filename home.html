        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>WACE DATABASE</strong>, the current largest (and only) database of past WACE questions with a question filtering and sorting system. Our easy to use tags system provides a simple way to get practice questions on just about any topic, making revising for WACE much easier, especially if you're not grinding all the WACE past papers. PDF downloads are avalaible for all questions, so you can easily print out questions and do them under simulated exam conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that the med and perfect ATAR tryhards are simply too good, which is why we have made it our mission to help everybody else mimic a fraction of their power. In theory, those who don't plan on doing all the WACE past papers will recieve great benefit from having sorted past questions to revise with. Additionally everybody benefits when revising weak points or in the earlier months before the entire course is learnt as the time taken to find questions to revise is greatly reduced.

        <h2>Tags Guide</h2>
        <p>
            Our database of past questions utilises a tags system to keep them organised. Each subject has its own set of tags, some of which describe the content of the question and some describe the type of question (short answer, multi choice, etc). Most of the content tags are collapsed under tag groups and organised by topic, and can be revealed by clicking on the arrow next to the corresponding tag group. Subtags as well as tag groups can be selected and act in the exact same way as other tags. Usually, questions with a subtag will also have the tag group of that subtag in its tags. When searching for tags, the 'or' mode will include all questions with at least one selected tag and 'and' mode will find all questions with all selected tags (there could be none).

        <h2>General ATAR Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <p>
            Here are some tips we have compiled from our own experience. Good luck with ATAR!
        </p>
        <h4>General:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Use WACE vaults and do more past papers. Nothing beats more practice and sinking in tens of hours every day. </li>
            <li>Don't be discouraged by the tryhard med students. Not only are they probably smarter than you, they work harder as well. You may be studying 12 hours every day, but they're studying 26 hours a day and spending an additional 5 grinding ucat.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Chemistry:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Memorise the marking keys for theory questions. Do it no matter what your teacher says, there's no point understanding the theory if you don't get the marks. However, do try to understand the theory as well, it does help.</li>
            <li>"You snooze, you loose!" – Ms Pilling 2023</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Physics:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't bother trying to undestand the standard model or special relativity. Just turn off your brain and plug in formulas.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Methods:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Your methods average can never be high enough. Remember, a 90 scales down to an 80 (true story).</li>
            <li>Given the current state of things, avoid taking methods if possible. It is currently way too competitive and scales poorly. If bonuses are removed at some point, methods becomes worthless.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Specialist:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Beware that year 12 is a lot harder than year 11. Your 90 average could become a 70 in an instant.</li>
        </ul>
