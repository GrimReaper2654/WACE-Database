        <h1>Games:</h1>
        <p>ATAR and exams are stressful, take a moment to relax and have some fun. All games here are created by Choyu.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/GrimReaper2654/Spaceship-Game" target="_blank">Spaceship Game</a></h2>
            <p>Top down 3rd person shooter with spaceships. Imagine diep.io but with spaceships instead of tanks. I made this at the start of year 11 and its my first project that used canvas.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/GrimReaper2654/Skibidi-Toilet" target="_blank">Skibidi Toilet Defence</a></h2>
            <p>A 3rd person top down shooter with surprisingly little brainrot (only the enemy models). Made this in term 1 of year 12 when some year 7 students wanted me to make something skibidi toilet related.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/GrimReaper2654/Gacha-Game" target="_blank">Gacha Game</a></h2>
            <p>An isekai anime themed gacha game with turn based combat I made in the middle of year 12. It used to be the only one of my games that ran on mobile but idk if mobile is still supported.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/GrimReaper2654/Taj-Game" target="_blank">Taj Game (Year 10 Compsci Project)</a></h2>
            <p>Funny year 10 computer science project. It probably still has a lot of bugs, even after I tried to fix all of them. Might crash a lot and you will lose progress if you play. Having to avoid the fatal bugs as you play is definitely an intended feature.</p>
