            <p>A group of like minded individuals with the goal of establishing a 'town' on the internet composed of many personal websites with their notes for their ATAR subjects and various study resources.

With a little effort and a lot of spare time, it might be enjoyable to dig through the Toomwn's histroy and see what you can find.</p>
