            <p>A group of like minded individuals with the goal of establishing a 'town' on the internet composed of many personal websites with their notes for their ATAR subjects and various study resources. Many of the toomwn's sites has combusted due to stress from exams and a lack of time (including mine), but some of the websites are still being maintained and all the github repos are still intact. With a little effort and a lot of spare time, it might be enjoyable to dig through the Toomwn's histroy and see what you can find.</p>
